them as buttons.

To test ASM functionality, a precompiled character was assigned to the vargammodel slot of the tester

These animations are linked to the other states like any other animation, with a simple transition.

- Limbified ragdolls are URGent compiled ragdolls with the 'Animate physics' flag checked in their Skinned Mesh
	Renderer component.
- Part breaking is based on kinematic functionality of individual bodyparts, which are transformed thanks to the direct
	access allowed by the URGent class.
- A broken part can be repaired by a later call to the breaking routine, with a different parameter.
- This feature can also be used to simulate animation states. For example an animated flower can be broken, and it will
	fall as if dead when limbified. To later bring the flower back to animation. Transition is instantaneous, but result
	can be satisfying in many cases, and without the extra work involved in ASM preparation.");
							GUILayout.Box(@"Setup information:
- The 'Soldier_Urgent_controller' character was ragdolled normally, but checking 'Add URG entity scripts', and adding a
	controller and the clsactorcontroller to it afterwards. The '_Tooncannon' model was prepared with the specific
	clscannon script, and in particular the 'cannonball' gameobject was prefabbed with the 'missile' tag.
- The soldier character parts are using the 'stock' clsurgentactuator class, that simply runs the 'OnCollisionEnter'
	event, monitoring the '-3' case from a 'missile' tagged gameobject.
- When the cannonball hits any clsurgentactuator host, the collision event is triggered, and the part is driven with a
	call to the metdrivebodypart function.");
